Roguelike Readme 
================

This is a filler readme to be replaced later.

This is my roguelike, using the libtcodpy library.  I've adapted the tutorial code from [here](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial%2c_using_python%2Blibtcod) to use an OO design paradigm.

Currently the monsters and item code isn't working properly, and the save/load stuff possibly isn't either.  I hope to have it back in a working state soon.

To run, simply download the source and run main.py.
